# About

### Thanks for stopping by!

I'm a self proclaimed "jack of all trades"
and pride myself in never being afraid to take on a new challenge.

If you're not learning, you're not growing.

My professional background began in music, and has since grown to include:

graphic design, web design/development, and photography.
